sh (previously [pbs](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pbs)) is a full-fledged
subprocess interface for Python 2.6 - 3.2
that allows you to call any program as if it were a function:

```python
from pbs import ifconfig
print ifconfig("eth0")
```

sh is not a collection of system commands implemented in Python.
